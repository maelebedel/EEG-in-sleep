# EEG-in-sleep
The objective of this project is to extract and process data from an electroencephalogram (EEG) of a sleeping patient in order to detect and highlight the different stages of sleep

This project is based on a one-night, single-lead EEG recording (data_eeg.mat) acquired at 100 Hz in an adult subject. 
The EEG device has been placed on the forehead.
The aim is to detect the different stages of sleep (REM, NREM, awake) based on changes in the characteristics of the EEG signal.
